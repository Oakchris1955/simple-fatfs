I'm tired of suckin' up
I'm tired of suckin' up and workin' for the man.
Keepin' people down 'cause the law book says I can.
Cuff my brothers and sisters, Oh, It's not the way to be.
But honey, those days are gone, 'cause baby, I am free.

Well, I don't need a badge to tell me wrong or right.
I don't need a badge to tell me day from night.
I don't need a badge 'cause my eyes can see.
I don't need a badge 'cause baby, I am free.

It's been a long, long time cleanin' up the streets.
Now papa's got a new gig, he's got a brand new beat.
It's called rock'n roll, and baby I hold the key.
This guitar here's my badge and music set me free.

Well, I don't need a badge to tell me wrong or right.
I don't need a badge to tell me day from night.
I don't need a badge 'cause my eyes can see.
I don't need a badge 'cause baby, I am free.

Well, I'm feelin' real fed up, so you'd better be aware.
I'm done with all your rules, 'cause, man, I ain't no square.
Music is my savoir with that you must agree.
This guitar here's my badge and music set me free.

I don't need a gun to make me feel strong.
I don't need a captain shootin' me down all day long.
I don't need your moustache. Don't you condescend to me.
I don't need nobody 'cause baby, I am free.

This guitar here's my badge.
Rock'n roll set me free.
This guitar here's my badge.
You better not try to take it from me

I don't need a gun to make me feel strong.
I don't need a captain shootin' me down all day long.
I don't need your moustache. Don't you condescend to me.
I don't need nobody 'cause baby, I am free.
Well I don't need nobody, baby, I am free.
